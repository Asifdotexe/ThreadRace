    "Rationale for Each Choice:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 1 Thread:\n",
    "Baseline comparison. Running tasks single-threaded shows how Python performs without multithreading, acting as a control for comparing thread management overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "* 2 Threads:\n",
    "This will help measure if there is an immediate improvement with just 2 threads, often useful for applications that rely on simple parallelism (e.g., dual-core systems).\n",
    "* 4 Threads:\n",
    "This represents a common setup for many consumer-grade CPUs (quad-core systems). It’s useful to see how well Python manages a moderate number of threads.\n",
    "* 8 Threads:\n",
    "For more modern machines that typically have 8 threads, this will show performance scaling on hardware like octa-core processors or hyper-threaded quad-core CPUs.\n",
    "* 16 Threads:\n",
    "Testing scalability with more threads helps in understanding Python's efficiency in handling high levels of concurrency, especially on multi-core systems.\n",
    "* 32 Threads:\n",
    "High-end desktop or server-grade hardware can support 32 threads or more. This helps test the upper bounds of thread management.\n",
    "* 64 Threads:\n",
    "On powerful machines with high core counts (like cloud VMs or high-performance servers), testing at this level highlights Python’s thread-handling capabilities in more extreme scenarios.\n",
    "* 128 Threads:\n",
    "This is primarily for understanding how Python handles an exceptionally high number of threads, which may start to show limitations or overhead due to thread management."
